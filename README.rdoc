== Welcome to GoCo

Empowering you to make good commuting choices.

Many of us wake up in the morning with a choice to either drive to work or take an alternate mode of transportation. More often than not we default to the most convenient option at the expense of our wallets, our health, and the health of our planet. Wouldn't it be great if there was an app that reminded you what the costs are of driving every day? Enter GoCo! GoCo shows you exactly what the trade off is in terms of money unnecessarily spent, calories not burned, and missed opportunities to reduce your carbon footprint ... empowering you to make good commuting choices. The team is also working on a built-in rewards engine and daily morning reminders to keep you on track and motivated.
